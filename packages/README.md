# `packages`
This directory consists of the main packages of create-guilded-bot, including the framework & the CLI.

## Development
In order to run a development server for all packages concurrently, consider running `pnpm dev` in the monorepo root. Turbo will start a dev server for all required packages.
In case you would like to run a standalone development server for a specific package, `cd` into the package directory and run `pnpm dev`. This should start a dev server for that package.
