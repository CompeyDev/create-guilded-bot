# `ðŸ“¦framework`
This directory consists of the core frameworks for both JavaScript and TypeScript, including a shared `tsconfig.json`.

## Development
Running a standalone development server for the TypeScript framework first requires dependencies for the shared tsconfig installed. Dependencies for all packages can be globally installed by running `pnpm i` in the monorepo root.
