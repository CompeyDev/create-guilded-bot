ðŸš€ This is a guilded bot created using [create-guilded-bot](https://github.com/CompeyDev/create-guilded-bot).

## Getting Started

In order to run the development environment, configure your .env file with the required variables and then execute the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or with yarn
yarn dev
```

Your bot should be online.

You can start editing the commands by adding/modifying files in the `commands` directory. An example help command is provided in
`commands/help.ts`.

Events can also be customized by adding files to the `events` directory corresponding to the name of the event. See `events/ready.ts` for an example event.

## Learn More

Since create-guilded-bot uses guilded.js, you can learn more from their [official docs](https://guilded.js.org/).
